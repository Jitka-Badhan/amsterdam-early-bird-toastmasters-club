        "question": "The meetings are nice, yet I am confused about how everything goes and what I should actually do. How do I make sense of everything?",
        "answer": "There's a lot of information to digest at the beginning. Don't worry if you need a bit of time! Read through this website quietly, check out <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.toastmasters.org</a>, and if you still have questions, feel free to ask your clubmates and the club officers. We are here for each other, and we know what it was like when we were starting. You’ll be fine ;-)"

        "question": "I need to do my Icebreaker speech - and I don't know how to start or what to do. Any advice?",
        "answer": "Your icebreaker speech is exactly what it seems to be - an icebreaker. Your clubmates are looking forward to getting to know you and to connecting - so you don't need to worry about making an absolutely wonderful speech now. This is not the point. You can relax, think of what you would like to share about yourself with your new club, and perhaps find inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB7d6fSS4Ak\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>. Enjoy the preparations!"

        "question": "I enjoy our meetings, and I would like to spread the word about our club. What is the best way?",
        "answer": "You are more than welcome to follow our club's <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/amsterdam-early-bird-toastmasters/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn page</a> and to like, comment and share all the posts! You can also invite people to join the meetings as guests. Nex to this, don’t be shy to discuss any ideas you might have on promotion of the club with the current Vice President for Public Relationships. The club is what we make out of it, and new ideas and initiatives are always welcome!"
