<section class="welcome__intro">
    <p>Congratulations on becoming a member of the Amsterdam Early Bird Toastmasters Club! We are very happy to have you as a member!</p>
    <p>This website serves to put all relevant information for club members on one place and as a substitute for documents scattered all over. It should not be used as a replacement for easy speak or to reflect any other meeting status - if that is what you search for, see quick links for redirecting.</p>
    <p>Ready to continue? Let's check together the <strong>basic rule of the club</strong> that is always to be remembered and let's make a <strong>solemn promise of a Toastmaster</strong>.</p>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h2>Remember...</h2>
        <p>Toastmasters is a <strong>volunteer</strong> organisation!</p> 
        <p>That means, club meetings only happen, when everyone contributes and takes part in organising it. Be it by giving a speech, taking on a meeting role, serve as officer, or be part in a committee. There are many opportunities to give and develop skills.</p>
        <p>The more we take part, the more successful we become as a club, and the more each one of us can grow!</p>
